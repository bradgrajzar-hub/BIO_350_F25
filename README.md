# BIO_350_F25

Starting our BIO350 assignments repo.

IC Assignments 1: Chapter 1 of Ecolodgy Handbook 
 - Making a differnece equation  
 -Technical difficulties, SHOULD be better from now on. 
 -It works now 


 IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook 
 -Exponential Analysis 
 -Making an exponential equation 

 IC Example 1: Log and conditional elements 
 Turned the graph from assignment 2 into a log using the log fn 
 Talked about if else statements in code
 
 IC Assignment 3: Section 3 Landslide Plant model 
- My code simulates the recolonization of a plant population using a simple discrete-time population model with a fixed mortality rate. Starting with an initial number of plants, the model calculates the number of survivors each year and allows the population to grow, without exceeding the carrying capacity. The simulation continues until the population reaches the carrying capacity, recording the number of plants each year. The results are visualized with a line plot showing population growth over time, and the code outputs the total number of years required for the population to reach its maximum size. This demonstrates basic population dynamics and logistic growth under constant mortality.

IC Example 2: Population Data Analysis

This notebook demonstrates how to import, visualize, and analyze population data using Python and pandas. The workflow includes:
-Importing population data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
-Plotting the population size over time using matplotlib, with a highlighted reference line at a population size of 276.
-Calculating the average population size between days 17 and 60.
-Displaying the result of the average calculation.
-This example provides a practical introduction to basic data analysis and visualization techniques in Python for ecological data.
