IC Assignments 1: Chapter 1 of Ecolodgy Handbook 
 - Making a differnece equation  
 -Technical difficulties, SHOULD be better from now on. 
 -It works now 


 IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook 
 -Exponential Analysis 
 -Making an exponential equation 

 IC Example 1: Log and conditional elements 
 Turned the graph from assignment 2 into a log using the log fn 
 Talked about if else statements in code
 
 IC Assignment 3: Section 3 Landslide Plant model 
- My code simulates the recolonization of a plant population using a simple discrete-time population model with a fixed mortality rate. Starting with an initial number of plants, the model calculates the number of survivors each year and allows the population to grow, without exceeding the carrying capacity. The simulation continues until the population reaches the carrying capacity, recording the number of plants each year. The results are visualized with a line plot showing population growth over time, and the code outputs the total number of years required for the population to reach its maximum size. This demonstrates basic population dynamics and logistic growth under constant mortality.
