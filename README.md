 -Making an exponential equation 

 IC Example 1: Log and conditional elements 
 Turned the graph from assignment 2 into a log using the log fn 
 Talked about if else statements in code
 
 IC Assignment 3: Section 3 Landslide Plant model 
- My code models the recolonization of a plant population in a plot over time, considering mortality and a maximum carrying capacity. It starts with an initial number of plants and simulates yearly cycles where a fixed proportion of plants die (mortality rate which is 40%), and the survivors produce new plants, but the total cannot exceed the CARRYING CAPACITY OF 400. The simulation continues until the population reaches the carring capacity. The results are plotted to show how the number of plants changes each year, and the total number of years taken to reach the maximum is printed.
